#### Raw Prompt Data

This directory contains files of *raw prompt data*. 

>[!NOTE]
> *raw prompt data* contains input and output data

##### Motivation
*raw prompt data* provides the building blocks for one-shot and few-shot prompts. If these building blocks are collected, it is easier to automate manual input-to-output processes at a later stage.

##### Process
Whenever I change text from one form to another and anticipate it would be helpful if that process were highly efficient in the future, I add a *raw prompt data* file to this directory. 

##### Expected Structure
A *raw prompt data* file should contain the following:

```bash
#### Context
(comments)
(links to useful external files/resources)

#### Input
(the original text)

#### Output
(the text after the input has been processed)
```
