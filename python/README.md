I learn about python and ground those lessons in the pytest codebase here.

##### resolve_package_path 
```python
#src/_pytest/pathlib.py
def resolve_package_path(path: Path) -> Optional[Path]:
    """Return the Python package path by looking for the last
    directory upwards which still contains an __init__.py.

    Returns None if it can not be determined.
    """
    result = None
    for parent in itertools.chain((path,), path.parents):
        if parent.is_dir():
            if not parent.joinpath("__init__.py").is_file():
                break
            if not parent.name.isidentifier():
                break
            result = parent
    return result
```

Observe that `itertools.chain` requires a variable number of iterable arguments.
