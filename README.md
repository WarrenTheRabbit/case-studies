# The Pytest Onboarding project
This repository starts the 'Case Study and Documentation' arm of the overarching goal stated in the [I want to encourage beginners to contribute by making refactoring pull requests](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11351) issue posted to the *pytest* repo: 

> If I can make the pytest codebase more accessible to beginners like me, maybe programmers will find some of the passion and professionalism they will need to make the world safer by being part of the pytest community.

[Pytest Issue #11351](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11351) is primarily a proposal that describes and gives an example for an algorithm that new developers could follow to make contributions: 

- Do [Extract Function/Method](https://refactoring.com/catalog/extractFunction.html) <br>
- [Type annotate](https://realpython.com/python-type-checking/) the extracted function <br>
- [Write a docstring](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html) for the extracted function <br>
- [Commit the refactoring](https://cbea.ms/git-commit/): refactor(optional scope): summary and a body for additional information and questions.

However, [pytest/issues/11351](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11351) also mentions that 'outreach and documentation of all stripes' could help onboard and inspire junior developers. 
This repository is part of that. I am creating it to store the notes, diagrams, prompts, experiments and case studies I create while learning and contributing to *pytest*. 

#### The Process
Over time, I hope to convert elements of this repository into documentation that is used by the *pytest* repository to help onboard and welcome junior developers. 
Combined with outreach and mentoring efforts, it is my hope that junior developers will "find intellectual, social and emotional welcome in the pytest community". 

#### The Vision
The larger hope is 'to increase the number of people who have a passion for something I think is very important': <br>
- testing systems and making them safer; and <br>
- building and maintaining testing tools so that others can make systems safer.
